            <p>Hangman is an intriguing word puzzle game that offers both entertainment and mental challenge. It's a classic game where players must guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a set number of attempts. The objective is simple: decrypt the word before the stickman meets his unfortunate fate. Each correct guess brings you closer to solving the mystery, while incorrect guesses inch you closer to losing the game. With a diverse array of words ranging from simple to complex, your vocabulary and deduction skills will be put to the test!</p>

<p>As you play Hangman, you'll find that the thrill lies not just in guessing letters, but also in the suspense of each turn. The game grants you limited opportunities to guess the letters of the word. For every wrong guess, a part of the stickman is drawn. The tension builds as you anxiously await the completion of the drawing, all while striving to reveal the word before the stickman hangs. How many words can you guess before running out of chances? Dive into the fun and find out!</p>

<h3>How to play free Hangman game online</h3>
<p>To begin playing Hangman, simply select a word from the list provided. Start guessing one letter at a time by clicking on the letters you think are in the word. If a letter is correct, it will appear in its designated spot; if not, a part of the stickman is drawn. Keep guessing until you either reveal the entire word or the stickman is completed!</p><br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Tap to play</p>
