        <div class="content-text">
            Players are dropped onto a map and start without weapons. The map is scattered with a wealth of weapons and equipment. Players need to constantly explore and collect these resources to enhance their survival ability and combat power. The core goal of the game is to be the last survivor. Usually, there are multiple players in each game, and they are randomly distributed on the map. As the game progresses, the safe zone will gradually shrink, forcing players to gather towards the central area, increasing the chances of encounters. Players need to search for weapons and other items that can improve their survival ability.<br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Mobile Control the character to move around the map using the virtual joystick Desktop Use WSAD to move and click the icon to perform actions such as firing sprinting healing and reloading</p>
