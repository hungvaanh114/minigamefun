            <p>Pac-Man Card Match invites players to immerse themselves in a captivating twist on the beloved classic arcade game. Originally designed by Toru Iwatani of Namco, Pac-Man debuted in Japan as PUCKMAN in May 1980 and quickly gained traction in the United States. It was released by Midway Games in October of the same year, right when arcade games were dominated by intense space shooters like Galaxian and Asteroids. The game redefined what it meant to engage in a maze chase, making Pac-Man a timeless classic and a symbol of 1980s culture.</p>

<p>The game mechanics are simple yet engaging: navigate through maze-like levels, munching on dots while strategizing to outsmart colorful ghosts.
