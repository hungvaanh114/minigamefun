The objective is simple yet engaging: you need to sort the cylinders by arranging them on different stacks. By clicking on a stack, you can move the topmost cylinder to either an empty stack or one that has a matching color on top. Each move you make counts, so strategy is crucial as you work against the clock.</p>

<p>The game features two distinct modes: Easy Mode and Hard Mode, each designed to challenge your sorting abilities at different levels. In Easy Mode, you'll encounter a generous number of stacks along with plenty of time to strategize your moves.
