            <p>Dirty Seven is an engaging shedding-type card game designed for two players, where the primary goal is to be the first to eliminate all the cards from your hand. At the onset, each player receives a hand of 7 cards, which they can view privately. The game commences with a single card placed face-up on the waste pile, while the remaining cards form the stockpile, set aside for later use.</p>

<p>Throughout the game, players take turns discarding one or more cards from their hands. To make a successful discard, the player must match either the rank or suit of the card currently on top of the waste pile. If a player finds themselves unable to discard a card because none of their cards match the one in the waste pile, they must draw from the stockpile until they can play. This mechanism creates excitement and strategic depth, as players must balance their hand while keeping an eye on potential moves from their opponent.</p>

<p>Strategically planning your moves and managing your cards is crucial to victory in Dirty Seven. As the game progresses, the dynamics shift, and players must adapt to the changing nature of their opponents' hands and the waste pile. Timing your discards and anticipating your opponent's moves can lead to a thrilling finish as you race to empty your hand first!</p>
