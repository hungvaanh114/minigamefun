            <p>Align 4 BIG is an engaging and strategic game that appeals to players of all ages. This vibrant adaptation of the classic Power 4 offers the same thrilling gameplay experience, designed for two players or against an AI opponent. The objective is simple yet captivating: align four pawns of the same color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a 6x7 grid.</p>

<p>In each turn, players choose a column to drop their colored pawn into. The pawn promptly descends to occupy the lowest available slot in that column. This mechanic not only adds a fun layer to the game but also requires players to think critically about their moves and anticipate their opponent's strategies. The gameplay continues until one of the players successfully connects four of their pawns in a line, thus claiming victory. However, if all spaces on the grid are filled without a clear winner, the game ends in a draw, challenging players to consider their moves carefully.</p>

<p>With its easy-to-learn rules and strategic depth, Align 4 BIG is perfect for casual players seeking a quick match or seasoned strategists aiming for intense competition. Its blend of simplicity and skill makes it a timeless classic that can be enjoyed solo or with friends.</p>
