            Night. You are struggling to sleep because there is clearly something wrong in this house... After a morning inspection, you found strange-looking plush toys (which someone has carefully left here!), and something about them terrifies you... Youve fallen asleep and suddenly woke up to the sound of the clock striking 12. And then the real nightmare began. The house is filled with unknown, evil sounds; the footsteps of both small, neat paws and big, fat plush paws can be heard everywhere... Its Spike and his friends who have begun hunting for you! All you have is a phone with cameras, a flashlight, and a few tennis balls! Good luck!<br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>On PC Holding or pressing X Activates various functions Holding or pressing Z Turns on the flashlight Look around Use the mouse by aiming the pointer at the sides of the screen All other controls are mapped to UI buttons</p>
