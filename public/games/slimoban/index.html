        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Slimoban is an exciting twist on the classic sokoban puzzle game, introducing players to a vibrant world of slimes and strategic challenges. The primary objective remains the same: move boxes to designated spots, but this time you must navigate a variety of colorful monsters that add complexity to the gameplay. As you journey through the game, you encounter three distinct types of slimes that each present unique obstacles.</p>

<p>The green slimes are stationary and can't be eliminated with fireballs; however, players can tactically push them into water to get rid of them. In contrast, blue slimes actively pursue you and can be defeated with fireballs or by pushing them into the water. Red slimes are relentless and can only be drowned, forcing you to think on your feet to avoid their chase. The interactions between slimes and fireballs are particularly engaging, as fireballs can not only defeat foes but also move boxes around the game board.</p>

<p>Players must pay attention to their surroundings, for blocks and certain slimes can fall into the water, leading to effective strategies but also potential traps. The game is structured with 30 challenging levels, ensuring that players remain engaged as they work through each puzzle. Each level tests not only your logic and strategic thinking but also your ability to quickly adapt to changing dynamics of the game.</p>
