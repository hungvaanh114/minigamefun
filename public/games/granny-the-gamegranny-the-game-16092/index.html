        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Granny the Game plunges you into a spine-chilling horror experience as you find yourself trapped inside the eerie home of a sinister old woman. With each passing moment, the tension rises as you explore the dimly lit corridors and rooms filled with unsettling sounds and foreboding silence. Your main objective is to escape her clutches before time runs out, but you must tread carefully; Granny possesses acute hearing and is ever-vigilant. Every noise you make, whether it s dropping an item or stumbling on the creaky floorboards, will alert her presence, causing her to sprint towards you in a frantic search.</p>
<p>Throughout your harrowing adventure, you must utilize stealth and strategy to navigate the confining space of Granny's house. You can explore different areas, but be prepared to listen closely and act accordingly, as Granny can appear out of nowhere at any moment, striking fear into your very core. Hide from her in wardrobes or beneath beds, biding your time and planning your next move. As the clock ticks down, you have only five days to devise an escape plan before it s too late.</p>

Will you master the art of stealth and outsmart Granny, or will her sharp instincts seal your fate? Dive into this horror adventure, but remember, silence is your only ally in this dread-filled journey.</p>
