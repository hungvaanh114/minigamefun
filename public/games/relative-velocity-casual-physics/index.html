            Relative Velocity is a casual 3D navigation game where you control a boat in an environment with waves and currents. The objective is to adjust the relative velocity vector to navigate a path to the finish line while collecting coins along the way. The boats movement physics has been carefully implemented manually to simulate the interaction with waves and currents, offering a fun and engaging experience about relative velocity. Scoring System: Points are based on two factors: the number of coins collected and the total time taken to complete the level. Progressive Levels: The difficulty increases with each level.<br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>How to Play Control the boats relative velocity vector using the on-screen joystick Follow the path to the finish line Collect coins along the way Complete levels as quickly as possible to achieve the highest score</p>
