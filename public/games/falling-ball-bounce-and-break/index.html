The blocks on the balls path contain free spaces that you need to fly through to continue moving. But be careful: traps lurk at every step, and one wrong move will lead to failure. Your goal is to guide the ball through all the blocks, collect the maximum number of points and, ultimately, get into the basket. For each successful flight between the blocks, you get points. And if you can overcome several blocks in a row without stopping, your points are multiplied!<br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Mouse click orControl the ball to guide it through the free spaces on the blocks and get into the basket at the end of the level Avoid the traps otherwise the game is over Basic rules Avoid the traps - they are on the blocks Getting into a trap ends</p>
