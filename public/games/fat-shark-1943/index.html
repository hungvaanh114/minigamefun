        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Fat Shark is an engaging HTML5 survival game centered around a hungry shark in a vibrant underwater world. In this game, you assume the role of a ravenous shark that is desperate for food and on the hunt for fish. However, players must navigate through a maze of challenges while ensuring that their shark doesn t overindulge. The objective is straightforward: gobble up as many fish as possible to satisfy your hunger.</p>

<p>As your shark feeds on the different types of fish swimming through the depths of the ocean, the reality that comes with overeating becomes evident. With each meal, your shark grows fatter and slower, making it increasingly difficult to avoid hidden dangers such as bombs scattered throughout the water. This balance between satisfying hunger and avoiding peril adds a layer of strategy to the game, as you must quickly decide whether to consume another fish or steer clear to evade disaster.</p>

<p>Fat Shark is not merely about mindless consumption; it s a test of skill and quick thinking. The more fish you eat, the fatter your shark becomes. Thus, your strategy should revolve around feeding your shark while keeping a keen eye on the surroundings. Players will enjoy the colorful graphics, engaging gameplay, and the thrill of survival in the underwater environment. Can you keep your shark well-fed without falling into a trap? Dive in and find out!</p>
