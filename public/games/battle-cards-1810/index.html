        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Battle Cards is an engaging card roguelike game that combines strategic movement with exciting card interactions. In this game, you guide your hero card across a dynamic playing field, where each move brings you into contact with various challenging cards that can dramatically affect your progress. For example, when you encounter monster or spike cards, your hero's health will diminish, adding a layer of risk to each movement.</p>

<p>However, the playing field is not solely filled with hazards. Healing cards are scattered throughout, providing opportunities for restoration, while gold cards help increase your overall score. Each decision you make while navigating this vibrant landscape transforms your gameplay into a series of intricate mini-puzzles. You must think critically about your next move every encounter is an opportunity to outsmart your opponents, bolster your card's capabilities, and ultimately emerge victorious.</p>

<p>The beauty of Battle Cards lies in its depth. Each playthrough is unique due to the random nature of the card placements, ensuring that no two games are the same. This unpredictability means players must continuously adapt their strategies based on the new scenarios presented with each level, creating an exhilarating gaming experience that keeps you coming back for more.</p>

<h3>How to play free Battle Cards game online</h3>

<p>To play Battle Cards, simply move your hero card around the board using the designated controls. As you make each move, observe the cards you collide with to strategize effectively. Focus on healing and gold cards while avoiding hazardous monster and spike cards. Good luck!</p><br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Mouse click or tap to play</p>
