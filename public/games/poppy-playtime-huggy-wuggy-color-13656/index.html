He preys on the player's anxiety, often stalking them silently from the shadows, venting systems, or high, inaccessible spots. The game escalates the tension when players are thrust into the dark conveyor belt tunnels, where a chase ensues. Failing to escape leads to a gruesome fate, as Huggy Wuggy reveals his sharp teeth, capturing players who can't reach the safety of the catwalk in time. </p>
