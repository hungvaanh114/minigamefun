        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Introducing "Traffic Control Math," an engaging and educational game designed to sharpen your arithmetic skills while managing the flow of traffic. In this innovative gameplay experience, players take on the role of a traffic controller, tasked with directing vehicles through a busy intersection. The game features four sets of arithmetic problems, each corresponding to a specific traffic light signal. As players answer questions correctly, they can turn the respective traffic signal green, allowing cars to pass. Meanwhile, all other signals will remain red, effectively controlling the busy intersection.</p>

<p>With each passing level, the challenge intensifies, requiring quick thinking and prompt decision-making. Your main objective is to solve as many arithmetic questions as possible within a time limit while avoiding traffic jams. The faster you answer, the more efficient you become at managing traffic. However, selecting the wrong answer will lead to failure in that level, making it crucial to stay focused and accurate as the pressure mounts.</p> 

<p>As you progress through the game, expect increasingly complex math questions and faster-paced traffic, testing your ability to balance speed and accuracy. "Traffic Control Math" is not just about driving skills; it's also about enhancing your mental math abilities in a fun and interactive way. Get ready to shift gears and guide the traffic with precision through various challenging scenarios.</p> 

<h3>How to play free Traffic Control Math game online</h3>
<p>To play "Traffic Control Math," simply click on the correct answer to the arithmetic question displayed on the screen. Each correct answer turns the associated traffic light green, allowing the traffic to flow smoothly. Remember, only one light can be green at a time, so choose wisely and quickly to keep the traffic moving and avoid congestion.</p><br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Use mouse or touch pad to play this game</p>
