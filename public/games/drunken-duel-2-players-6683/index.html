The AI will present varying challenges, ensuring that every match feels fresh and engaging. Each match comprises five rounds, where your main goal is to knock your rival's energy down to zero first. The player who succeeds in reducing their opponent's life force scores points, while their own energy levels reset for the subsequent rounds.</p>
