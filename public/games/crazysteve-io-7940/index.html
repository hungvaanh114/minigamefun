Plus, you can utilize unique tactics, such as throwing dynamite to clear out the competition while simultaneously risking your own health.</p>

<p>The battlefield is filled with various protective helmets and carts, offering additional defense against enemy attacks. With apples and diamonds scattered throughout, focus on the center of the map where intense battles unfold, but don t forget to check the edges for hidden treasures!</p>
