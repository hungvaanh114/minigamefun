            <p>Utsuru Infection immerses players in a thrilling multiplayer horror experience, where tension and strategy are key. Set in a hauntingly atmospheric environment, this 4vs1 game finds one player assuming the role of Reimu, a determined hunter, while the other four players take on the guise of cunning Youkai. The objective for Reimu is to locate and eliminate all Youkai, while the Youkai work together to evade capture and escape the relentless pursuer. This dynamic creates a pulse-pounding chase that keeps everyone on their toes, as the Youkai utilize stealth and cunning to outmaneuver Reimu.</p>

<p>Recently, Utsuru Infection introduced an engaging single-player mode. In this mode, players still control Reimu, but they must navigate a different set of challenges, attempting to defeat all Youkai before falling victim to their strategy. This new feature allows players to hone their skills and experience the game from a fresh perspective. However, the stakes are high, and if the Youkai identify Reimu first, she must rely on her wit and agility to escape, as getting caught means defeat. The interplay between hunter and hunted in both modes offers an exhilarating experience that will keep players coming back for more.</p>

<p>The eerie graphics and haunting sound design contribute to the overall ambiance, making every session of Utsuru Infection richly immersive. Players must learn the strengths and weaknesses of their characters, coordinate plans in multiplayer mode, and adapt their strategies to survive. Whether playing with friends or diving into the single-player challenge, Utsuru Infection promises to deliver heart-pounding excitement and unforgettable moments.</p>
