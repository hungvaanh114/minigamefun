        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>In the whimsical world of <strong>Kara Jet</strong>, players step into the adorable, albeit plump, shoes of a flightless chicken with big dreams. This charming little creature is determined to explore the vast lands beyond its coop, but there s a catch: it can t fly! Instead, our feathery friend relies on a makeshift jet pack to get around. However, due to its limited budget (after all, it s a chicken!), the jet pack is less than high-quality and can only provide short bursts of flight.</p>

<p>As you guide this cute chicken on its adventures, you'll have to navigate through various challenges that lie in your path. The game invites players to flap through an array of obstacles while utilizing the limited bursts of jet pack power. Each leap through the air must be carefully timed, as the chicken must dodge trees, rocks, and other hindrances that threaten to disrupt its journey. The aim is to cover as much distance as possible, all while enjoying the lighthearted and colorful environment that is designed to entertain players of all ages.</p>

<p>With each successful attempt, you ll find yourself refining your skills, learning to maneuver through tight spots, and maximizing the use of your jet pack to reach new heights even if just for fleeting moments. It s an endearing and exciting challenge that promises fun and laughter as you help your poultry protagonist soar (or rather, flap) toward its travel dreams!</p>
