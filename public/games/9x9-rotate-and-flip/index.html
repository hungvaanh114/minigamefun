<p>In 'By Time' mode, the pressure is on as you race against the clock. You have a limited time to make moves, but fear not! You can earn extra seconds by clearing entire rows or columns that contain the Time power-up. Utilize your skills to keep the clock ticking while eliminating pieces from the board.</p>

<p>Lastly, the 'Bombs' mode raises the stakes even higher. Here, you need to strategically destroy rows or columns that contain bombs. If a bomb detonates before you've managed to defuse it, your game ends in an explosive finale! Can you navigate the challenges and master all three modes?</p>
