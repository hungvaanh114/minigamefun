        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>In the game <strong>Leftovers</strong>, you find yourself on a peculiar mission set by your mother who is keen on minimizing food waste. She has just prepared a copious dinner and, rather than tossing out the leftovers, she assigns you the rather daunting task of delivering them to your neighbors. Despite the unsettling instruction of having to engage with strangers, especially the creepy kind, you must step outside of your comfort zone to accomplish this mission and make your mum proud.</p>

<p>Your journey through the neighborhood is both amusing and unnerving as you encounter a diverse cast of characters. Some neighbors are friendly, while others are downright bizarre. You might meet a man who gets alarmingly close, sniffing around you in an attempt to catch a whiff of your mother s cooking scent. The tension is palpable, and moments such as these are what make <strong>Leftovers</strong> a uniquely unsettling experience.</p>

<p>One unfortunate encounter involves an inviting lady whose hospitality should be met with skepticism. The game thrives on providing players with different reactions and decisions that lead to unexpected interactions. From awkward conversations with an old man to the occasional elusive neighbor, the experience feels refreshingly immersive despite its eerie undertone. You are merely a child asked to deliver food, yet you find yourself navigating through a landscape of quirky, and at times, terrifying individuals.</p>
