You'll need to click on the screen to initiate the ball's descent, while a moving array of platforms shifts beneath it, each waiting to catch the ball. The catch? The platforms must match the color of the ball; otherwise, your game will come to a halt as the ball plummets into the abyss.</p>

<p>As you progress, you'll find yourself able to switch the colors of the platforms by engaging with the three colored levers positioned at the bottom of the screen.
