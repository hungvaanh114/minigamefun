Dedicated fans admire him for his reliability and underdog status, as well as the charm of his iconic mustache. This evolution not only highlights Luigi's unique traits but also positions him as a formidable rival to his superstar brother. While both brothers possess considerable strength and skills, Luigi's agility may give him a slight edge when it comes to completing tasks like scoring from a Question Block, which is quite the straightforward endeavor in their adventurous world.</p>

With Luigi's charisma and fan support always by his side, fans love to see their hero take center stage in epic battles against Mario.
