        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Blackjack is an engaging card game that has captivated players around the globe for centuries. The primary objective is simple: to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21. Players are dealt two cards, and they can choose to 'hit' to take additional cards or 'stand' to keep their current total. The challenge lies in the strategic decisions players must make based on their cards and the dealer s visible card.</p>

<p>The game typically uses one or more standard decks of 52 cards, and each card has a specific value. Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, while face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are valued at 10. Aces can be counted as either 1 or 11, offering flexibility in forming a strong hand. Players aim to reach a total that is as close to 21 as possible without going over, which is known as "busting."</p>

<p>As players engage in the game, they must consider various strategies that can enhance their chances of winning. These strategies may involve analyzing the dealer's up card, managing betting sizes, and knowing when to take risks. The social element of Blackjack, whether played in a casino or with friends, adds an exhilarating layer to the experience, making every hand unique and thrilling.</p>
