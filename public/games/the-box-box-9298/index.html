        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>The Box Box is an engaging puzzle-solving experience that invites players to push boxes into their designated spots across over 70 unique challenges. Each level presents a fascinating array of interactive elements such as tornadoes, portals, one-way passages, locks and keys, as well as blocks and barriers. These features elevate the traditional box-pushing mechanics into layers of complex problem-solving scenarios.</p>

<p>Inspired by classic games like Sokoban and Box World, The Box Box goes beyond merely pushing boxes. Players must strategically interact with the environment to eliminate barriers, unveil new paths, and explore creative solutions even when the answer isn't immediately clear. The game gradually ramps up in difficulty, demanding increasingly sharpened reasoning, logic, and puzzle-solving skills.</p>

<p>The diverse interactions available within each puzzle include boxes that can only be pushed one at a time, tornadoes that can reposition objects, and one-way passages that direct movement based on arrow indications. Players will also encounter locks and keys that require careful maneuvering to unlock passages, as well as holes that create barriers needing to be covered by blocks. Portals add a magical twist, allowing for teleportation and creative navigation across levels. Each puzzle is designed to challenge the mind, making players think outside the box literally!</p>
