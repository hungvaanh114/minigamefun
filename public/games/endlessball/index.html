            Endless Ball looks deceivingly simple at first glance &amp;amp;ndash; just keep the ball bouncing and rack up those points. But dont let its minimalist design fool you! This addictively challenging game has turned even the most confident players into humble beginners. While 99% of players think theyll master it in minutes, only 2% have ever scored higher than 20 points! The rules are straightforward: tap to keep the ball in motion, avoid obstacles, and survive as long as you can. Yet, this seemingly basic gameplay transforms into an intense test of reflexes, timing, and concentration.<br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Mouse click or tap to play</p>
