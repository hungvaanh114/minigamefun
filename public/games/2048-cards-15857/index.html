        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>2048 Cards is an incredibly engaging card game inspired by the popular 2048 puzzle mechanism. In this game, players need to carefully stack cards in columns, each bearing a numerical value. The objective is to combine these cards, stacking them wisely until their total reaches 2048, at which point the cards will disappear from the board. The challenge lies in the strategic placement of cards, as once they are set down, there is no option to remove them. Therefore, players must think ahead and plan each move meticulously.</p>

<p>As you navigate through the gameplay, you have a limited number of discards available. This introduces an additional layer of strategy, as improper management of your discards can lead to situations where you have no valid moves left. Consequently, players must judiciously use their discards to optimize the board and maximize their chances of clearing all the cards. With each play session, the excitement and challenge increase, as you strive to make the perfect moves that will lead to card removal and ultimately a game-winning score.</p>

<p>The thrill of 2048 Cards lies in its addictive nature, urging players to achieve higher and higher scores while honing their strategic and critical thinking skills. So gear up for some brain-teasing fun and see how many cards you can make disappear!</p>

<h3>How to play free 2048 Cards game online</h3>
<p>To play 2048 Cards, simply drag the cards into the columns to combine them. Ensure that the card values you stack add up to 2048 to remove them from play. Use your discards wisely and think ahead to avoid getting stuck. Maintain a clear strategy to make the best moves!</p><br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Use mouse to play the game</p>
