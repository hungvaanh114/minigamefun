            <p>American Football, commonly known as football in the United States and Canada, embodies a thrilling competition played between two teams, each comprised of eleven players. The game unfolds on a rectangular field equipped with goalposts at either end. The essence of the sport lies in the offensive team, which holds the oval-shaped football and strives to move it along the field by either running or passing. Meanwhile, the defensive team intensively works to prevent the offense from successfully advancing and seeks to gain possession of the ball.</p>

<p>In this strategic matchup, the offensive team has four attempts or  downs  to advance the ball a minimum of ten yards. If they achieve this yardage within the allotted downs, they are awarded an additional four plays to continue their quest for points. However, failure to advance the required distance results in a turnover, handing possession to the opposing side. Scoring opportunities arise primarily through touchdowns, where players cross into the opposing team s end zone, or by successfully kicking the ball between the other team's goalposts for a field goal. Ultimately, the team that accumulates the highest score by the end of the game emerges as the victor.</p>
