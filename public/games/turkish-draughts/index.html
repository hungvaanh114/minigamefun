            The main feature is that moves and captures with checkers are made horizontally and vertically, and not diagonally, as in most popular types of checkers. Accordingly, the initial arrangement of checkers is different. On a 64-cell board, opponents place their 16 checkers on all cells of the second and third horizontals. You can play the game with artificial intelligence, with another person on one device, or with an opponent online in multiplayer mode. You can also watch other players play, act as a spectator, or suggest your own version of the next move to the player by making it on the board.<br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Mouse click or tap to play</p>
