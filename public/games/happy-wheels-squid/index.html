        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Happy Wheels Squid has emerged just as the unsettling demise of Flash approaches. We understand the nail-biting anticipation surrounding this change and apologize for any inconvenience caused. We hope the anxiety of potentially losing Happy Wheels didn t disrupt your sleep. If you were unaware of the game's ongoing development, we're excited to bring you some wonderful news.</p>

<p>This release marks the first public availability of the game, and we kindly ask for your patience as we work through some lingering bugs. Although Flash holds a special place in my heart, what truly impresses me about this iteration is its performance on mobile devices. Currently, this version lacks on-screen mobile controls, but rest assured, they will be integrated in the next update. For those eager to play on their phones, using a Bluetooth keyboard is a great alternative.</p>

<p>While I've mentioned that the game typically runs at 60 frames per second, certain challenging levels may experience a slight dip in performance. This has been noted, and I'm considering hosting a 60 Hz version for users with exceptionally powerful CPUs. Generally, the gameplay and design of Happy Wheels JS remain faithful to the original experience. The user database, levels, and replays have been preserved, meaning you can still enjoy the familiar chaos without the looming fear of the universe's end.</p>

<h3>How to play free Happy Wheels Squid game online</h3>

Navigate through various levels filled with obstacles and hazards while aiming to reach the finish line. Utilize boosts and avoid dangers to maintain your progress.
