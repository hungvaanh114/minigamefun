            <p>Step into the world of <strong>Master Tetris</strong>, where strategy and quick thinking collide in a classic puzzle challenge! In this iconic game, players are faced with an array of falling shapes known as "tetrominoes." Each tetromino consists of four connected squares, offering a variety of configurations to maneuver as they descend towards the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>As the game unfolds, players are tasked with thoughtfully rotating and shifting these geometric shapes to fill complete rows across the play area. Successfully aligning these rows will cause them to vanish, granting valuable points and a sense of accomplishment. However, the challenge intensifies as the speed at which the tetrominoes fall increases with each passing moment, testing your reflexes and tactical prowess.</p>

<p>The goal of Master Tetris is to continuously clear rows by strategically placing the tetrominoes with as few gaps as possible. Players must maintain focus and think several steps ahead to avoid becoming overwhelmed as the screen begins to fill up. Each move counts, so the ability to adapt quickly can mean the difference between progressing in the game and facing an untimely game over.</p>

<h3>How to play free Master Tetris game online</h3>
<p>To play Master Tetris online, use the arrow keys to control the falling tetrominoes. The up arrow rotates the shape, while the left and right arrows move it horizontally. Press the down arrow for a quick drop. Your objective is to clear lines by positioning the tetrominoes skillfully. Good luck!</p><br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Click to play</p>
