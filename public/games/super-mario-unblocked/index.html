        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>In the exciting world of <strong>Super Mario Unblocked</strong>, players step into the shoes of our beloved hero, Mario, as he embarks on a thrilling adventure through the whimsical Mushroom Kingdom. The main objective is to thwart the malevolent plans of Bowser, the game s notorious villain, and save the charming Princess Toadstool from his clutches.</p>

<p>As Mario journeys through various levels, players must navigate obstacles and avoid enemies while aiming to reach the flagpole marking the end of each level. Collecting coins is essential, as they not only add to the player's score but also contribute to unlocking special features. Throughout the game, players will encounter unique question-mark bricks that, when hit, unveil coins and special items that can aid in their quest. Exploring these bricks is crucial, as they often contain valuable rewards that can enhance gameplay.</p>

<p>Power-ups play a significant role in <strong>Super Mario Unblocked</strong>. Eating a mushroom transforms Mario into Super Mario, doubling his size and granting him the ability to break blocks that were previously out of reach. While in this enhanced form, being hit will cause Mario to shrink back to his original size, ensuring players still have a chance to continue their journey without the risk of game over.</p>

<h3>How to play free Super Mario Unblocked game online</h3>
