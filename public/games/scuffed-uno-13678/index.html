        <h3>Hướng dẫn cách chơi / Instructions:</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Experience the excitement of Uno like never before with <a href="https://www.kizi10.org/game/play/scuffed-uno">scuffed uno</a>, an online version of the beloved card game playable directly in your web browser. Your primary objective is straightforward: be the first to shed all your cards, much like other Crazy Eights inspired games. Gather a group of 2 to 4 players and get started!</p>
<p>To excel at Scuffed Uno, it s crucial to develop various strategies. The core gameplay revolves around matching the color or number of the previously played card. If you find yourself without a playable card, simply draw from the pile until you can make a move. Remember, when you have only one card left, hit the <strong>UNO</strong> button; failing to do so will grant you two penalty cards!</p>
<p>The game utilizes a deck consisting of 108 cards, of which 70% are number cards ranging from 0 to 9 in four different colors. Each color has 19 cards, including one zero card and two of each number from one to nine. The remaining 30% comprises action cards and wild cards that pave the way for more strategic gameplay.</p>
<p>Action cards are integral to the game's strategy, with three types included in the deck. Each color features two of each: the Skip card makes the next player miss a turn, the Reverse changes the play direction, and the Draw Two card forces the subsequent player to draw two cards while skipping their turn. Meanwhile, wild cards offer even more versatility; there are 2 types that allow players to choose the next color to play or force an opponent to draw four cards.</p>
<h3>How to play free Scuffed Uno game online</h3>
<p>To start playing Scuffed Uno, simply join a game with your friends or play with random opponents. On your turn, match the card on top of the pile by color or number. Draw from the pile when you have no playable cards and remember to call <strong>UNO</strong> when you're down to your last card to avoid penalties!</p><br><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Left click to choose the cards</p>
