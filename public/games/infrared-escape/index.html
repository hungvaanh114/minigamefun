            <p>EarthGames is excited to unveil <strong>Infrared Escape</strong>, a dynamic arcade experience that cleverly integrates education on the greenhouse effect within its gameplay. Players assume the role of an infrared light beam, navigating the challenges of escaping Earth s atmosphere and making the journey into space. As you maneuver, you must adeptly dodge the intrusive greenhouse gases that threaten your energy levels. Each encounter with these gases will sap your beam's energy, and repeated collisions can lead to game over.</p>

<p>Your atmospheric adventure is structured in various levels, each representing a different layer of the atmosphere. Successfully traversing each layer not only brings you closer to the ultimate goal of reaching space, but also symbolizes your contribution to cooling the Earth and combating global warming. The game offers different difficulties, allowing you to start in the year 1850, which has fewer greenhouse gases, before advancing to a more challenging, polluted future scenario that requires lightning-fast reflexes to navigate through the densely packed gases.</p>

<p>Upon successfully escaping to space, you prevent excess energy from contributing to global warming. Additionally, you can utilize the energy you've saved in the in-game shop to unlock fascinating scientific facts about the greenhouse effect and actionable solutions for addressing climate change. Play <strong>Infrared Escape</strong> to have fun while learning about pressing environmental issues!</p>
